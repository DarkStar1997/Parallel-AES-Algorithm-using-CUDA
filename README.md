# Parallel-AES-Algorithm-using-CUDA
This project parallelized the process of AES encryption with CUDA. We can enhance the overall speedup to 3 times than the original serial version.

//compile using Makefile
make

//run
./AES [file to encrypt] [key file] [filename of encrypted file] [filename of decrypted file]
